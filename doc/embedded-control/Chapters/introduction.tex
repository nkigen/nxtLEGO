\section{Introduction}

An experiment to determine the parameters for a \LEGO motor was carried out and the results are presented here. Different power values for the motor are set and the tacho count is recorded, filtered and analysed for each power value. 
\newline



Since the motor is already known to act as a second order system, a grey box approach was used to identify the damping factor, $\xi$ and the natural frequency, $\omega _n$. 
\newline



Also, since for each power value we have an estimate of $\xi _{est}$ and $\omega _{est}$ which results into an overdetermined system, a simple average of the $\xi _{est}$ and $\omega _{est}$ values is done in order to determine the the final $\xi$ and $\omega _n$ values.
\newline



Finally a set of verification data is used to check the accuracy of our model and from it, performance indices are calculated.
